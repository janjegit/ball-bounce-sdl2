# SDL2 Ball Physics Simulation

## Overview

This project was born out of a desire to explore the SDL2 library
and to practice programming in C. It's a simple demonstration wherein a ball
bounces around within a window, adhering to the basic principles of physics. As
an additional exercise, the ball's position is displayed at the top of the
window.

## Features

- **Ball Physics**: The ball moves and bounces according to fundamental physics
  principles, reacting to user input.
  
- **Position Display**: To practice rendering text with SDL2, the current
  position of the ball is shown at the top of the window.

### Prerequisites

- SDL2 Library
- SDL2_image Library

### Compilation 

Use the provided Makefile to compile the project:

```bash 
$ make 
```

Run the generated binary to start the simulation: 

```bash 
$ ./bin/game 
```
